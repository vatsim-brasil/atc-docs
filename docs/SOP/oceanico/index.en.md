???+ warning "Attention!"
    Any position within the Atlântico FIR is part of **Tier 2** of the GCAP. To control, it is mandatory to have specific authorization obtained through approval in the Atlântico Control Course, which will soon be available at the Vatsim Brasil Training Center.

The Atlântico FIR is one of the 5 FIRs under the jurisdiction of Vatsim Brasil. Due to its location and the nature of its service, covering more than 11 million square kilometers over the Atlântico Ocean, it has operational specialties that differ from the other FIRs covering the continental portion.
